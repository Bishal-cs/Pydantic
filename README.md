# Pydantic Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Pydantic Learning Repository**! This repository is designed to provide a beginner-friendly yet comprehensive exploration of **Pydantic**, a powerful data validation and settings management library for Python. Through structured examples and mini-projects, you will learn how to use Pydantic to write clean, robust, and type-safe Python code.

---

## üìå Topics Covered

* **Introduction to Pydantic**: Understanding the core features and advantages of using Pydantic in Python.
* **Creating and Using `BaseModel`**: Defining models and leveraging built-in validation features.
* **Type Hints and Automatic Validation**: Utilizing Python‚Äôs type hints for automatic data validation.
* **Default Values and Required Fields**: Handling optional and required fields in models.
* **Field Constraints and Metadata**: Applying constraints like minimum and maximum values.
* **Custom Validation Methods**: Writing custom validation logic to extend Pydantic‚Äôs capabilities.
* **Parsing from Dictionaries and JSON**: Loading data from various formats into Pydantic models.
* **`.dict()` and `.json()` Methods**: Converting Pydantic models to dictionaries and JSON for serialization.
* **Nested Models and Complex Types**: Working with nested models and defining complex types.
* **Practical Use Cases and Mini-projects**: Exploring real-world examples and projects that demonstrate Pydantic‚Äôs potential.

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.10** or higher installed on your machine.

This project utilizes the [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager. If you don‚Äôt have it, install it via:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bishal-cs/Pydantic-Learning.git
cd Pydantic-Learning
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install
```

Or, if using `pyproject.toml`, the package manager will handle dependencies for you automatically.
