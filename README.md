# Pydantic Learning Repository

A beginner-friendly exploration of **Pydantic** ‚Äî Python's powerful data validation and settings management library. This repository contains structured code examples and projects that demonstrate how to use Pydantic for robust, type-safe, and clean Python development.

---

## üìå Topics Covered

* Introduction to Pydantic
* Creating and using `BaseModel`
* Type hints and automatic validation
* Default values and required fields
* Field constraints and metadata
* Custom validation methods
* Parsing from dictionaries and JSON
* `.dict()` and `.json()` methods
* Nested models and complex types
* Practical use cases and mini-projects

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher.

This project uses [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the Python package manager. If not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bishal-cs/Pydantic-Learning.git
cd Pydantic-Learning
```

### Install Dependencies

Or if using `pyproject.toml`, uv handles it directly:

```bash
uv pip install
```
